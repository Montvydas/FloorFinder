# TangoPositioning

##Intro
I am a Univeristy of Edinburgh Electronics Students and I share my Master's project contents in here. The project is 
based around Google Tango device. Currently in the release there is [Google Tango Tablet] (https://store.google.com/product/project_tango_tablet_development_kit) and Lenovo Cosumer 
SmartPhone [Phab 2 Pro] (http://shop.lenovo.com/gb/en/tango/). 

The aim of the project is to create an Indoor Positioning system based on main Vision and some other sensors.
